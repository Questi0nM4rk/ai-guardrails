Review PR #$ARGUMENTS in this repository.

## Step 0: Load Context

```bash
git show claude-reviewer/memory:MEMORY.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No project memory yet — fresh project."
cat .cc-review.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "No project config — using defaults."
```

Store both the memory and config. Use them throughout the review.

## Step 1: Gather PR

```bash
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,files
gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS
```

## Step 2: Triage

If the diff is trivial (version bumps, config-only, dependency updates, markdown edits), approve immediately:

```bash
cat > /tmp/review-payload.json <<'EOF'
{"body":"LGTM — trivial change, no review needed.","event":"APPROVE","comments":[]}
EOF
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/reviews --method POST --input /tmp/review-payload.json
```

## Step 3: Understand the Change

Before reviewing line-by-line:

- Read the PR title and description to understand intent
- Identify which areas of the codebase are touched
- Cross-reference with memory for known patterns in these areas
- For large diffs (>500 lines): launch `Explore` subagents (subagent_type: "Explore") to research
  each module group in parallel. Explore agents cannot spawn further agents, preventing cascades.

## Step 4: Review the Changes

For each file changed, check for:

- Bugs: null refs, off-by-one, race conditions, incorrect logic
- Security: injection, auth bypass, secrets in code, insecure defaults
- Data loss: missing transactions, incorrect deletes, broken migrations
- Breaking changes: API contract violations, removed public members

Apply `.cc-review.yaml` overrides:

- Skip `ignore_paths` files
- Skip `known_patterns` findings
- Apply `instructions` context

## Step 5: Post the Review

CRITICAL: Post exactly ONE review using a SINGLE `gh api` call. ALL findings go in this ONE call.

### Building the payload

1. Collect ALL findings from Step 4 into a flat list — no severity labels, no ranking
2. For each finding that maps to a specific line in the diff:
   - Verify the line exists in the diff output (NEW file side, the `+` lines)
   - Add to `comments` array with `path`, `line`, `body`
   - The `body` is just the issue description + fix suggestion — no "Bug (MED):" prefix
3. For findings that CANNOT map to a valid diff line (e.g. missing functionality, cross-file issues,
   or lines you can't verify):
   - Put them in the review `body` as bullet points — NOT as inline comments
   - NEVER use `line: null` — that creates broken separate comments
4. If any findings exist → `"event": "REQUEST_CHANGES"`. If zero → `"event": "APPROVE"`

### Payload format

```json
{
  "body": "Summary of findings.\n\n- Finding without a diff line: description here",
  "event": "REQUEST_CHANGES",
  "comments": [
    {"path": "src/file.ts", "line": 42, "body": "Issue description and suggested fix."}
  ]
}
```

### Submit

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/reviews --method POST --input /tmp/review-payload.json
```

### Verification before submitting

- Count findings in your list. Count comments in the JSON. Count body bullet points. They MUST add up.
- Every `line` value must be a real line number from the diff. If unsure, put it in the body.
- Every `path` must match the diff exactly.
- The `body` should list any findings that aren't inline. If all findings are inline, body is just a short summary.

## Step 6: Update Memory

If you learned new patterns, false positives, or conventions — save via memory-save command.

## Rules

- Post ONE review via ONE `gh api` call — never multiple calls
- ALL inline comments inside the `comments` array — never separate API calls
- NEVER use `gh pr review` — always `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/N/reviews`
- NEVER use severity labels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) — every finding is a requested change, no ranking
- NEVER post a comment with `line: null` — put those findings in the review body instead
- If you found N issues, ALL N must appear in the review (inline + body). Do not drop findings.
- Sub-agents MUST be launched with subagent_type: "Explore" — never "general-purpose". Explore agents
  cannot spawn further agents, preventing runaway cascades that freeze the CI runner.
- Be concise — no filler, no padding
- Trivial diffs → approve immediately
