            Review PR ${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} with comprehensive analysis:

            1. **Code Quality**: Check for code smells, complexity, maintainability, DRY violations, proper naming
            2. **Bugs & Logic Errors**: Identify potential runtime errors, edge cases, null/undefined handling
            3. **CLAUDE.md Adherence**: Verify all project-specific guidelines from CLAUDE.md are followed
            4. **Best Practices**: Language-specific idioms, design patterns, error handling
            5. **Performance**: Inefficient algorithms, unnecessary computations, memory leaks
            6. **Security**: Injection vulnerabilities, authentication/authorization issues, data validation
            7. **Testing**: Test coverage for new code, edge case coverage, test quality
            8. **Documentation**: Code comments where needed, function/class documentation

            After review:
            - Post inline comments on specific lines with issues
            - Provide an overall summary as a PR review
            - If no critical/major issues: APPROVE the PR
            - If critical/major issues found: REQUEST_CHANGES with clear explanation

            Focus on: actionable feedback with specific line references, severity (critical/major/minor), and suggested fixes.
